# Convolabel
is a simple program that allows percentage-based labelling of conversational blocks. Essentially, it is a modified version of [IDSLabel](https://github.com/babylanguagelab/bll_app/tree/master/src/app/IDSLabel/client) to label conversations instead of speech segments.

## Installation (for Windows):

The program requires three additional python modules - [PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). These can be installed via python's package manager Pip with the following in the command prompt:
```
pip install pyaudio matplotlib numpy
```
To start the program, double-click on the `convolabel.py` icon. If that does not work, you might need to [associate python files with python executable](https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html#executing-scripts).

Alteratively, open the program folder -> `Shift + right-click` -> `Open command window here`. In the command window, type: `python convolabel.py`

Optional: if you do not want the black console window to pop up when you open the program, add 'w' to the extension of the file name (so that it becomes `convolabel.pyw`)

## How it works

1. When the program opens, type in your name. The labels will be saved under this name, so several coders can label the same block independently.

2. Then, click `Load` to pull up the conversational blocks. The program looks for pre-processed blocks in the `output` folder (see [How to make blocks](#how-to-make-blocks))

3. Select a block and click `Play` to listen to the whole block.

   * If the block is too long, label its parts separately. Each part is 15 seconds long or less and stops at the segment boundaries.
   * If you choose to label block parts, you can't label whole block any more
   * The labelled parts will appear in the exported Excel sheet as `block_n-part_n`

4. Type in labels in the windows below. The labels are organised in the following way:

   * Adult-directed speech
   * Child-directed speech
       * Mother
           * At target child
               * Directive
               * Nondirective
               * Uncertain
           * At other child
       * Other female(s)
       * Male(s)
       * Unsure
   * Other Child Speech
   * Junk (yes/no)
   * Sensitive (yes/no)
   * Other language (yes/no)


   Provide your estimate of how much of each type of speech there is in a block. Enter your estimates as categories:

   | Category | Meaning | Amount in % |
   | :---: | :---: | :---: |
   | 0 | None | 0 |
   | 1 | Some | 1 - 33 |
   | 2 | Half | 34 - 66 |
   | 3 | Most | 67 - 99 |
   | 4 | All | 100 |

   Note that if you are labelling *Child-directed speech*, and most (category 3) of it is coming from a *Mother*, then some (category 1) of that speech must come from *Other female(s)*, *Male(s)* or from other folks who you're *Unsure* about.

   Another scenario: *Mother* speaks half (category 2) of *Child-directed speech* in a block, and the rest is divided (not necessarily equally) between *Another female* (category 1) and a *Male* (category 1). In total, there is 2 (half) + 1 (some) + 1 (some) = 4 (all).

   Lables in the first column do not have to add up to 4 (All), but their sum should not be greater than 4. In all other columns, the labels should add up to 4.


5. After you have finished labelling a block (or its part), click `Submit` or `Ð¡trl+s`. This will tell the program that you'd like it to remember everything that you've entered. This won't, however, save your labels to the hard drive! Click `Menu` -> `Save data` to do so.

   Select another block by clicking on its name in the list (or arrow up/down). Blocks that have been labelled will appear grey in the list.

6. When you finish working, click `Menu` -> `Save data` (or `X` button -> `Save`). This will save the labels on the hard drive. You can see the data file under the `labelled_data` folder: it will have the coder's name and a .pkl extension (e.g. `Ivan.pkl`). Do not delete or move to another location any of these files (unless you want to reset the data). When you re-open the program, it will pull these file and load all previous labels.

   After you have saved the data, it is safe to exit the program. In case you forget to save, a prompt will show up asking whether you really want to exit without saving. Also, as soon as the data has been modified , a little star will appear next to the program's title. It disappears if the data is saved!

   Note that you have to `Submit` the labels after each block, but you only need to `Save data` once you have finished a session and want to exit (although saving a couple of times during a session does not hurt).

7. If you want to export the data in an Excel file, click `Menu` -> `Export to csv`. This will create an Excel spreadsheet with all the labelled data. You can save over previous exported excel sheets: you won't lose anything. You are exporting all accumulating data from all coders every time. You can export as often as you want and delete these Excel data sheets. They do not matter for the functioning of the program.


Other options:

- to set ADS/IDS example, click `Menu` > `Set ADS/IDS sample` and select a clip. This will attach the example to a recording, and you can play it when that recording is selected.



## How to make blocks

1. Place the folders for each recording in the `input` directory. These folders should contain .wav recording and .cha file that has been exported using CLAN software.

2. Open the program, click `Menu` -> `Make blocks`

3. The program will check whether each folder contains one .cha and one .wav file and whether their names match. Then, processing of the recordings will begin. You should see a lot of activity in the black terminal window that opens up with the program. When the processing is done, a message will appear on the screen and the program will load everything from the `output` folder, where the processed blocks are stored.


## Backups

To make sure that no data is lost by mistake, the program saves all block entries in the `Name.db` file under the `labelled_data` folder. This is a simple database file that is intended to keep track of data changes every time a coder clicks `Submit` button. If a program crushes unexpectedly or if a coder forgets to save, it is possible to recover most of the data from these files. It is possible to open and explore these files by istalling [Sqlite browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) app.


## Hot keys

- `space`			        = play the seected block
- `control` + `s`		    = submit the labels to the memory
- `arrow up`        	    = select previous block/recording
- `arrow down`				= select next block/recording
